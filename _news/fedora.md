Exciting news! My paper titled "FEDORA: A Flying Event Dataset fOr Reactive behAvior", co-authored with Wachirawit Ponghiran, Adarsh Kumar Kosta, Manish Nagaraj, and Kaushik Roy is going to presented at the IROS 2024! With this work, we're trying to answer the question of end-to-end training of an autonomous robot's perception pipeline. The result? A fully-synthetic event-vision dataset!
