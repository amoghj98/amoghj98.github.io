Research Update!
My paper titled "SHIRE: Enhancing Sample Efficiency using Human Intuition in REinforcement Learning", co-authored with Adarsh Kumar Kosta and Kaushik Roy is going to be presented at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025!

This work addresses the well-known challenge of poor sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Our approach leverages Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) to incorporate task-specific human intuition directly into the RL training process, thereby significantly enhancing sample efficiency and highlighting the potential of human-guided RL for robotics.
