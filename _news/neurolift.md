My paper titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19259">"Neuro-LIFT: A Neuromorphic, LLM-based Interactive Framework for Autonomous Drone FlighT at the Edge"</a> was accepted at IJCNN 2025, in the special session "LLMs in Motion: Transformative Advances in LLMs for Autonomous Navigation and Decision-Making at the Edge". In this work, we leverage an LLM for natural language processing, translating human speech into high-level planning commands which are then autonomously executed using event-based neuromorphic vision and physics-driven planning.
