Two works from NRL at Purdue University will be presented at the 40th Anniversary of the IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA@40) this week!
I will be presenting my recent work <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00931'>"Real-Time Neuromorphic Navigation: Integrating Event-Based Vision and Physics-Driven Planning on a Parrot Bebop2 Quadrotor"</a>, which is a real-world extension of my colleague Sourav Sanyal's work <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10382663'>"EV-Planner: Energy-Efficient Robot Navigation via Event-Based Physics-Guided Neuromorphic Planner"</a>, which is also being presented at the same venue.
