I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University working with <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=to4P8KgAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Kaushik Roy</a>. I received my B.Tech in Electronics Engineering from the University of Mumbai, India.

My doctoral research focuses on creating robust and resilient robots using bio-inspired, and physics- and human intuition- guided robot learning techniques. By optimizing the robot learning pipeline, these techniques create explainable and efficient robotic control policies.

I have presented a few of my research works, such as <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09990'>'SHIRE: Enhancing Sample Efficiency using Human Intuition in REinforcement Learning'</a> at leading forums such as the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) and the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), among others.

My primary interests are in field of Reinforcement Learning and Robotics, with emphasis on techniques for enabling efficient and explainable policy learning, in-situ failure recovery, and physics-informed policy learning.
